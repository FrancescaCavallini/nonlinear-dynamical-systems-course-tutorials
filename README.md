# Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Part 3 - Tutorial

This repository contains tutorials for the course Nonlinear Dynamical Systems, taught
at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

The tutorials cover Part 3 of the course, which gives elements of pattern formation
in parabolic PDEs. The course is given to mathematics students who have followed an
introductory Dynamical Systems course, have little background on PDEs, and no
background in Functional Analysis. Hence its emphasis is on parallels/contrast with
ODEs, and formal calculation.
